What is an ATC license, and how do ratings work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An ATC licence is a legal document allowing the licence-holder to provide Air Traffic Control Services 
and attests that the holder has been trained in for the national ATC procedures, aviation law and meteorology. 
ATC training enables ratings to be added to the licence that permit the licence-holder to provide specific types of ATC services. 
The following ratings may be obtained:

* Tower and Approach Control Procedural Rating
* Area Control Procedural Rating
* Area Control Surveillance Rating






How long is the training, and where does it take place?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The training school can last for 2-3 years.  
Approximately 1 year of the training is held at one of Cyprus International Airports, the rest of the training period is held in Nicosia.

During the training period you are considered to be a student with a small allowance of 800 euros.



What qualifications are required, and are there medical standards?
